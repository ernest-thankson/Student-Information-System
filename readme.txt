GENERAL INFO
This is a student information system with a graphical user interface created using tkinter. It was created in a team of three for our final Data Structures and Algorithms project in the first semester of our 2nd year. I designed the user interface and wrote much of the background code. It was written in Python.

PROJECT INFO
The system does not depend on a database but rather on text files for storage. It stores student data for four University classes. Users can add student data, add student majors and view class and student records. The major problem with this application is that it does not allow users to modify or delete data from the user interface. These feature was not added due to a lack of time. We abandoned the project after Data Structures.
